##Problem Statement -> round 1

Rahul has multiple credit cards of different banks and each of these banks generate card statements in different formats. In order to analyse his statements, Rahul needs our help to standardise them in single format. To help Rahul, we need to write a code that can normalise any statement in a standard format. You can write code in any language. Take reasonable assumptions and made the code as generic as possible. Look at all input files and output files before starting to code.
 
Attached are 2 Input Test Case files, all of them will have same output data. Refer to the attached standard format-output file and use the CSV format to write the output!!

##Problem Statement -> round 2

Rahul has multiple credit cards of different banks and each of these banks generate card statements in different formats. In order to analyse his statements, Rahul needs our help to standardise them in single format. To help Rahul, we need to write a code that can normalise any statement in a standard format. You can write code in any language. Take reasonable assumptions and made the code as generic as possible. Look at all input files and output files before starting to code. But because you have 60 minutes, start by at least solving for first 2 cases and aim to solve for 3rd case. If you are able to solve for 3rd case as well in time, ask us to give you the 4th case as well, if your code works without making any changes on 4th as well, that will be added bonus. But in the interest of time, focus on writing the code to solve for at least first 2 cases. In case you are running low on time you can ignore the “location” column from standard output file as well.
