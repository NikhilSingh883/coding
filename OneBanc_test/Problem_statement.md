Problem Statement-

Rahul has multiple credit cards of different banks and each of these banks generate card statements in different formats. In order to analyse his statements, Rahul needs our help to standardise them in single format. To help Rahul, we need to write a code that can normalise any statement in a standard format. You can write code in any language. Take reasonable assumptions and made the code as generic as possible. Look at all input files and output files before starting to code.

 
Attached are 2 Input Test Case files, all of them will have same output data. Refer to the attached standard format-output file and use the CSV format to write the output!!
